## Background de-blanker, by Kf4btg {A} Github
# --A bare-bones conkyrc which creates a pseudo-
# transparent desktop window; i.e. one that draws onto itself 
# whatever is drawn to the *real* root window below , the latter being
# hidden when using certain compositors like KWin. 
# This way, should one not wish to run a desktop-environment like Plasma
# nor one of the file-managers that controls the desktop (e.g. Nautilus,
# PCManFm), one can still have a nice personalized desktop wallpaper
# by using this along with an external tool like feh, nitrogen, or xsetroot
# to set the background image.
 
# TODO: get rid of some of the cruft in here.
# TODO: wrap it up in a script with some handy options
# TODO: See if the concept can't be made independent of conky,
#       maybe even just pull the corresponding code out of conky,
#       since we don't need the vast majority of it's features for this.
